 *
 * Generic "beam"/"bolt"/"ball" projection routine.
 *
 * Input:
 *   who: Index of "source" monster (zero for "player")
 *   rad: Radius of explosion (0 = beam/bolt, 1 to 9 = ball)
 *   y,x: Target location (or location to travel "towards")
 *   dam: Base damage roll to apply to affected monsters (or player)
 *   typ: Type of damage to apply to monsters (and objects)
 *   flg: Extra bit flags (see PROJECT_xxxx in "defines.h")
 *
 * Return:
 *   TRUE if any "effects" of the projection were observed, else FALSE
 *
 * Allows a monster (or player) to project a beam/bolt/ball of a given kind
 * towards a given location (optionally passing over the heads of interposing
 * monsters), and have it do a given amount of damage to the monsters (and
 * optionally objects) within the given radius of the final location.
 *
 * A "bolt" travels from source to target and affects only the target grid.
 * A "beam" travels from source to target, affecting all grids passed through.
 * A "ball" travels from source to the target, exploding at the target, and
 *   affecting everything within the given radius of the target location.
 *
 * Traditionally, a "bolt" does not affect anything on the ground, and does
 * not pass over the heads of interposing monsters, much like a traditional
 * missile, and will "stop" abruptly at the "target" even if no monster is
 * positioned there, while a "ball", on the other hand, passes over the heads
 * of monsters between the source and target, and affects everything except
 * the source monster which lies within the final radius, while a "beam"
 * affects every monster between the source and target, except for the casting
 * monster (or player), and rarely affects things on the ground.
 *
 * Two special flags allow us to use this function in special ways, the
 * "PROJECT_HIDE" flag allows us to perform "invisible" projections, while
 * the "PROJECT_JUMP" flag allows us to affect a specific grid, without
 * actually projecting from the source monster (or player).
 *
 * The player will only get "experience" for monsters killed by himself
 * Unique monsters can only be destroyed by attacks from the player
 *
 * Only 256 grids can be affected per projection, limiting the effective
 * "radius" of standard ball attacks to nine units (diameter nineteen).
 *
 * One can project in a given "direction" by combining PROJECT_THRU with small
 * offsets to the initial location (see "line_spell()"), or by calculating
 * "virtual targets" far away from the player.
 *
 * One can also use PROJECT_THRU to send a beam/bolt along an angled path,
 * continuing until it actually hits somethings (useful for "stone to mud").
 *
 * Bolts and Beams explode INSIDE walls, so that they can destroy doors.
 *
 * Balls must explode BEFORE hitting walls, or they would affect monsters
 * on both sides of a wall.  Some bug reports indicate that this is still
 * happening in 2.7.8 for Windows, though it appears to be impossible.
 *
 * We "pre-calculate" the blast area only in part for efficiency.
 * More importantly, this lets us do "explosions" from the "inside" out.
 * This results in a more logical distribution of "blast" treasure.
 * It also produces a better (in my opinion) animation of the explosion.
 * It could be (but is not) used to have the treasure dropped by monsters
 * in the middle of the explosion fall "outwards", and then be damaged by
 * the blast as it spreads outwards towards the treasure drop location.
 *
 * Walls and doors are included in the blast area, so that they can be
 * "burned" or "melted" in later versions.
 *
 * This algorithm is intended to maximize simplicity, not necessarily
 * efficiency, since this function is not a bottleneck in the code.
 *
 * We apply the blast effect from ground zero outwards, in several passes,
 * first affecting features, then objects, then monsters, then the player.
 * This allows walls to be removed before checking the object or monster
 * in the wall, and protects objects which are dropped by monsters killed
 * in the blast, and allows the player to see all affects before he is
 * killed or teleported away.  The semantics of this method are open to
 * various interpretations, but they seem to work well in practice.
 *
 * We process the blast area from ground-zero outwards to allow for better
 * distribution of treasure dropped by monsters, and because it provides a
 * pleasing visual effect at low cost.
 *
 * Note that the damage done by "ball" explosions decreases with distance.
 * This decrease is rapid, grids at radius "dist" take "1/dist" damage.
 *
 * Notice the "napalm" effect of "beam" weapons.  First they "project" to
 * the target, and then the damage "flows" along this beam of destruction.
 * The damage at every grid is the same as at the "center" of a "ball"
 * explosion, since the "beam" grids are treated as if they ARE at the
 * center of a "ball" explosion.
 *
 * Currently, specifying "beam" plus "ball" means that locations which are
 * covered by the initial "beam", and also covered by the final "ball", except
 * for the final grid (the epicenter of the ball), will be "hit twice", once
 * by the initial beam, and once by the exploding ball.  For the grid right
 * next to the epicenter, this results in 150% damage being done.  The center
 * does not have this problem, for the same reason the final grid in a "beam"
 * plus "bolt" does not -- it is explicitly removed.  Simply removing "beam"
 * grids which are covered by the "ball" will NOT work, as then they will
 * receive LESS damage than they should.  Do not combine "beam" with "ball".
 *
 * The array "gy[],gx[]" with current size "grids" is used to hold the
 * collected locations of all grids in the "blast area" plus "beam path".
 *
 * Note the rather complex usage of the "gm[]" array.  First, gm[0] is always
 * zero.  Second, for N>1, gm[N] is always the index (in gy[],gx[]) of the
 * first blast grid (see above) with radius "N" from the blast center.  Note
 * that only the first gm[1] grids in the blast area thus take full damage.
 * Also, note that gm[rad+1] is always equal to "grids", which is the total
 * number of blast grids.
 *
 * Note that once the projection is complete, (y2,x2) holds the final location
 * of bolts/beams, and the "epicenter" of balls.
 *
 * Note also that "rad" specifies the "inclusive" radius of projection blast,
 * so that a "rad" of "one" actually covers 5 or 9 grids, depending on the
 * implementation of the "distance" function.  Also, a bolt can be properly
 * viewed as a "ball" with a "rad" of "zero".
 *
 * Note that if no "target" is reached before the beam/bolt/ball travels the
 * maximum distance allowed (MAX_RANGE), no "blast" will be induced.  This
 * may be relevant even for bolts, since they have a "1x1" mini-blast.
 *
 * Note that for consistency, we "pretend" that the bolt actually takes "time"
 * to move from point A to point B, even if the player cannot see part of the
 * projection path.  Note that in general, the player will *always* see part
 * of the path, since it either starts at the player or ends on the player.
 *
 * Hack -- we assume that every "projection" is "self-illuminating".
 *
 * Hack -- when only a single monster is affected, we automatically track
 * (and recall) that monster, unless "PROJECT_JUMP" is used.
 *
 * Note that all projections now "explode" at their final destination, even
 * if they were being projected at a more distant destination.  This means
 * that "ball" spells will *always* explode.
 *
 * Note that we must call "handle_stuff()" after affecting terrain features
 * in the blast radius, in case the "illumination" of the grid was changed,
 * and "update_view()" and "update_monsters()" need to be called.
